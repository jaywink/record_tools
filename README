Record Tools
============

Just a little Python project to help identify, label and handle recorded audio. I use it to digitize my ~500 vinyl record collection.

Uses Discogs (https://github.com/discogs/discogs_client) to get release information. For mp3 ID tags, eyeD3 library (http://eyed3.nicfit.net/) is used.

Filenames in source directory are in format CATNO_TRACK_CONDITION.mp3. So for example: LBL001_A_VG.mp3

Features;
1) Uses Discogs API to get release, artist and track information. 
2) Asks user to confirm and choose when information is not clear.
3) Inserts release to MySQL DB with information from Discogs
4) Sets mp3 ID tags, renames the files and copies them to given folder

Let me know if you find this useful (or need help using it) :)
